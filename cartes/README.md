# Librairie Of Cards

## Introduction

This is a complete API for playing cards. It is written in Java 8 and is designed to be used in any Java project.
The API is designed to be as simple as possible, while still being powerful enough to be used in any card game. 
It is also designed to be as flexible as possible, so that it can be used in any project, no matter how big or small. 
The use of the API is very simple, so that it can be used by anyone, even if they have never used an API before.
We provide for the user a model of a card, a deck of cards, and a hand of cards. We also provide a graphical representation
of all of these objects, so that the user can see what is happening in the game.

## Model

The model of a card is very simple. It has a suit and a value. The suit can be one of the following: HEARTS, DIAMONDS, SPADES, CLUBS.
The value can be one of the following: ACE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, TEN, JACK, QUEEN, KING.

The model of a deck of cards is also very simple. It is a list of cards. The deck of cards is shuffled when it is created.

The model of a hand of cards is also very simple. It is a list of cards. The hand of cards is empty when it is created.
